# fakeOS
A small project where I make a fake OS in python
- oh cool it can exec-file-open
- and it's got my bad version of CS:GO
- and the READMEs are pretty bad tbh
- look if it isn't obvious I don't take this seriously
- wait i forgor i made a bad calculator too
- and a trash shell remake

Made in thonny

This project was made because I only know python, which isn't a good skill to make an operating system. So, I resorted to dishonesty.
Then fakeOS came into existence. With fake loading times, dishonest usefulness, and code that is pretty hard to use, fakeOS is pretty cool.
It was made at school in my spare time. I designed it to be easy for people to edit and share. That's it, hopefully fakeOS isn't too bad.
