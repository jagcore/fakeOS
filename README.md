# fakeOS
A small project where I make a fake OS in python
- oh cool it can exec-file-open
- and it's got my bad version of CS:GO
- and the READMEs are pretty bad tbh
- look if it isn't obvious I don't take this seriously
- wait i forgor i made a bad calculator too
- and a trash shell remake

Made in thonny
